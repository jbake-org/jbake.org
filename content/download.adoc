== SDKMAN

You can also install JBake via http://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN] (Software Development Kit Manager - formerly known as GVM) if you are running a Bash based platform (Mac OSX, Unix, Linux, Cygwin or Solaris etc.).
SDKMAN will take care of downloading the latest distribution, installing it and configuring your environment for you.

After you have SDKMAN installed enter the following command to install the latest version of JBake:

----
$ sdk install jbake
----

Once complete you can then get baking!

== Homebrew

You can also install JBake via http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] if you are running OS X. After you have installed Homebrew enter the following command to install the
latest version of JBake:

----
$ brew install jbake
----

Once complete you can then get baking!

== Docker

An official https://hub.docker.com/r/jbake/jbake[Docker image] is available if you would prefer to run JBake in a Docker container. To execute a bake using the Docker image run the following command from your project folder:

----
$ docker run --rm -u jbake -v "$PWD":/mnt/site jbake/jbake:latest
----

This command will execute using the jbake user to avoid running as root and will mount the current working directory as /mnt/site in the Docker container where
JBake is expecting your project files to be. By default the Docker image will execute a bake (-b) only. If you want to bake and serve your project using the Docker
image then you'll need to override the default command:

----
$ docker run --rm -u jbake -v "$PWD":/mnt/site -p 8820:8820 jbake/jbake:latest -b -s
----

This command will also expose port 8820 from the container, however you will also need to set the https://jbake.org/docs/latest/#default_hostname_for_server_mode[default hostname]
in your jbake.properties file.

== Maven

JBake artifacts are available from the Maven central repository:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jbake</groupId>
	<artifactId>jbake-core</artifactId>
	<version>${jbakeVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: When using the core library make sure you declare the https://jbake.org/docs/latest/#use_as_library[optional dependencies] you require.
